url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@hotel.cfsr5z3txahe.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com:1521:ORCL

user=TimHarrell

password=revature

"

place the file on the desktop


SQL FILE:

please do not run this, it contains scripts that are not meant
to run in order ( I realize this violates ACID)

it was used to make some of the tables and for testing sql statements


NOTES:

Create a new user by incorrectly logging in. I am working on making
a separate link.
Host mainly does things by submitting information in the main body.
Guests mainly does things by selecting an option, then selecting a sub option on the right, then submits information

Login automatically detects if the user is a guest or host.

Servlets and SQL do everything intended (except upload an image).

Html display of the web page is not finished. It looks weird, but is readable. Working on this. ( I know what is wrong with it)
